## Adding Songs
Local files such as mp3, mp4, wav, etc. can be uploaded directly. <br />
Youtube URL links can be pasted in the "YouTube Search" tab and added to queue. <br />
All songs and videos can be downloaded and saved to "Library" on your local computer, stored on the browser (actual files cannot be directly accessed). <br />
Currently, YouTube videos cannot be saved to the "Library". <br />
